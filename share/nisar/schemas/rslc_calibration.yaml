# This is a Yamale schema (see https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale) for
# validating calibration parameter files for the NISAR RSLC PGE.

# Free-form information from the processing facility about how the parameters in
# this file were generated or other relevant information.
Notes: str(required=False)

# When this file was generated or updated by the processing facility, in
# ISO-8601 date format.
Date Generated: timestamp()

# The parameters in this file are valid for data acquired in the following date
# range (ISO-8601 date format).
Valid for Data Acquired After Date: timestamp()
# Upper bound may be null if not known at time of file generation.
Valid for Data Acquired Before Date: timestamp(required=False)

# The reference range is used to normalize the range loss correction.  Typically
# it'd be a range near the middle of the swath so that the (R / Rref)^4 term
# stays near unity.  Since changing it would also change the absolute scale
# factor it should be held fixed across scenes and is included here.
# Defaults to 900e3 m
Reference Range (m): num(required=False)

Calibration:
  # Default calibration parameters.  Mode-dependent overrides take precedence.
  Default: include('cal_params', required=False)

  # Any subset of parameters may be overridden based on the bandwidth in
  # operation.  For example, different SSP filters may have different delays.
  Override 5 MHz: include('cal_params', required=False)
  Override 20 MHz: include('cal_params', required=False)
  Override 40 MHz: include('cal_params', required=False)
  Override 77 MHz: include('cal_params', required=False)
