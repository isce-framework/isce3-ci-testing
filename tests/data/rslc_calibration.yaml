# NISAR RSLC Calibration Parameters File
# NISAR_LCAL_20220101T120000_01.yaml

# Free-form information from the processing facility about how the parameters in
# this file were generated or other relevant information.
Notes: >-
  Image calibration parameters generated by JPL based on NISAR L-band data from
  OBS_ID=xxxx over "Site Name" corner reflectors.

# When this file was generated or updated by the processing facility, in
# ISO-8601 date format.
Date Generated:  2023-01-19T12:27:10.0

# The parameters in this file are valid for data acquired in the following date
# range (ISO-8601 date format).
# Either bound may be null if not known at time of file generation.
Valid for Data Acquired After Date: 2022-01-01T12:00:00.0
Valid for Data Acquired Before Date: null

# The reference range is used to normalize the range loss correction.  Typically
# it'd be a range near the middle of the swath so that the (R / Rref)^4 term
# stays near unity.  Since changing it would also change the absolute scale
# factor it should be held fixed across scenes and is included here.
# Defaults to 900 km
Reference Range (m): 900e3

Calibration:
  # Default calibration parameters.  Mode-dependent overrides take precedence.
